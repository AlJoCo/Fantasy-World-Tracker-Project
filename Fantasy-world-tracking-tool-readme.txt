# Fantasy Tracking Tool

## Purpose
The aim of the app is to assist fiction writers in maintaining logical continuity within their worlds, particularly when a lot of characters are involved.

## Functionality
The app is designed to take in a variable number of fictional characters as a string, locations as strings, and generic time increments to be interpreted by the user. With these inputs, the app will highlight when and where characters will interact; for the user to decide how.
